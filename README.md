# Credit Card Default Prediction using Machine Learning

## Problem Statement
Credit card default prediction is an important problem for financial institutions, as it helps in identifying customers who are likely to default on their credit card payments. The objective of this project is to build and compare multiple machine learning classification models to predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment in the next month based on their demographic and financial attributes.

An interactive Streamlit web application is developed to allow users to upload a dataset, select different machine learning models, and evaluate their performance using standard classification metrics.
